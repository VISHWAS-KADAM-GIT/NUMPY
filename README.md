# NumPy Operations Practice 📊🐍

This repository contains my practice work on **NumPy**, where I performed various array-based operations used in **Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Scientific Computing**.

The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in NumPy by experimenting with real operations instead of theory alone.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- NumPy array creation  
  - `array`, `zeros`, `ones`, `arange`, `linspace`

- Indexing & slicing (1D, 2D, boolean indexing)
- Shape manipulation  
  - `reshape`, `flatten`, `ravel`, `transpose`
- Stacking & concatenation  
  - `hstack`, `vstack`, `concatenate`
- Broadcasting concepts
